# CodeIgniterProject

The purpose of this project was to get an introduction into working with MVC design using the CodeIgniter PHP Framework and implementing an API as part of a site.  A brief description of the model, views, and controllers in this project are below and later the use of the Leaflet API in this project is discussed.


<h2>Model</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The News_model class inherits from the CI_Model class and its constructor includes a method to load CodeIgniter's database library.</li>
  <li>A simple database was created in MySQL for the News_model to access.</li>
  <li>CodeIgniter has access to a Query Builder class which allowed a desired query to only be written once.  In this case a query was written once to get all news records from the database or a news item using its slug category from the database.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Controllers</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The News controller loads the data from the News_model either by getting all of the news data at once or each news item.  The controller then passes data to the view index.php in the index method or a news item in the view.php in the view method.</li>
  <li>The Pages controller passes hard coaded data to the home page view for the site.</li>
  <li>The Ajax controller processes data from the Ajax request sent from email.js and then returns a response that's processed client side.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Views</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The primary views for the site include the pages views, news views, and templates.</li>
  <li>The pages views include the about page, contact page with the AJAX request, and a home page.</li>
  <li>The news views include the index page where all news items are listed and the view page where each item will be displayed.</li>
  <li>The templates pages include the common header and footer for all pages.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Leaflet Map</h2>
<p>The leaflet map's purpose was to add a map to the front page of the recipe site where the user can click on country images on the map to see recipes from that part of the world.  A map object with cutom wide view is included with map icon objects that include flag images and marked on to specific locations on the map object.  Links are added on the icon locations with href attributes that lead to a recipe from that part of the world and bound to the markers on the map.
